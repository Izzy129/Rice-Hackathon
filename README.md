## Inspiration
We wanted to learn how to use Pygame in addition to making investing easier for new traders.
## What it does
Plays out a puzzle game to help learn stock ticker symbols.
## How we built it
We used the Python library **PyGame**, which did a lot of the heavy lifting graphic-wise and helped us focus on the game's design.
## Challenges we ran into
Working on the same code was difficult for all of us because we had never used Git before. Learning how Git worked, in addition to Pygame, was a difficult challenge to overcome in this short period of time.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of how aesthetically pleasing the game turned out.
## What we learned
Object-oriented programming, basics of Pygame, basics of Git.
## What's next for Capital Connect
A flip animation for the cards.
Implementation of an online leaderboard with a thorough score system. 
Better transition animations using PyGame.
Sound effects/ Music.
